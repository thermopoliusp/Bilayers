# First lipid layer: the polar head is oriented to down to the water
# molecules.
# 50 lipids will be put inside a box of side 40. in the x and y
# directions and 14. in the z direction (14 is a little more than that
# length of the lipid). The atoms 31 and 32 of the pdb file of this
# lipid, which belong to the polar head, will be constrained to be
# below the the plane z = 2., and the atoms 1 and 2, which are the
# hydrophobic end of the lipid will be constrained to be over the plane
# z = 12. Therefore, all the lipids will be oriented, with their polar
# heads pointing to the water box below.
