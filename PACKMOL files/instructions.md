# Initial configurations for Molecular Dynamics:

[PACKMOL](http://m3g.iqm.unicamp.br/packmol) was used to generate the initial configurations for Molecular Dynamics of each system. 

Here we provide three examples:
- randomly allocated molecules
- lipid bilayer
- lipid monolayers with triacylglycerol between them

The molecules (already in the Martini 3 coarse-grained configuration) are also available.

Official input examples are available [here](https://m3g.github.io/packmol/examples.shtml).
