# First lipid monolayer: the polar head is oriented to down to the water

# 64 lipids will be put inside a box of side 50 in the x and y
# directions and 21 in the z direction.
# The atoms 1 and 2 of the pdb file of this
# lipid, which belong to the polar head, will be constrained to be
# below the the plane z = 5., and the atoms 11 and 12, which are the
# hydrophobic end of the lipid will be constrained to be over the plane
# z = 16. Therefore, all the lipids will be oriented, with their polar
# heads pointing to the water box below.
